Introduction

The core model is the traditional sequence-to-sequence model with attention. It is customized (mostly inputs/outputs) for the text summarization task. The model has been trained on Gigaword dataset and achieved state-of-the-art results (as of June 2016).

The results described below are based on model trained on multi-gpu and multi-machine settings. It has been simplified to run on only one machine for open source purpose.
